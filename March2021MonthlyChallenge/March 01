#Distribute Candies

#Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.

#The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). 
#Alice likes her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies while still following the doctor's advice.
#Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2
